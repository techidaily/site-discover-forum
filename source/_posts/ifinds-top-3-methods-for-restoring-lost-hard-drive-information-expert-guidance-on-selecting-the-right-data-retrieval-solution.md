However, failure can also happen in situations like mishandling, power surges, fire, or water that can damage its internal components or make the drive dead.

****Corruption:** This happens when an internal hard drive gets corrupted. In such cases, boot won’t happen because of damage to the master boot record or boot configuration data.

****Deletion:** This is one of the most common scenarios when you can lose data. for example, You deleted certain files like a document, photo, video, email message, audio, or archive file that go to the Recycle the Recycle Bin but hit the Deleted Key without peeking into these files.

## ****3 Methods to Recover Hard Drive Data**

### ****Check the recycle bin for Recover Hard Drive Data**

This is a common and easy method to recover data from the recycle bin. As we delete files from our laptop or computer, they go directly to the recycle bin instead of being permanently deleted. The only time this doesn’t happen is when the file is too large to be sent there or the recycle bin is already full.

So, this is a viable option to check the recycle bin before moving on to any other data recovery solutions:

Open the Recycle Bin on your computer.

As it opens, you can see all the deleted files there. Right-click your file and select “Restore” to retrieve files back to other drives. If you want to recover multiple files, hold Ctrl and select all desired files before clicking right to recover them.
