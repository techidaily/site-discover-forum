If you previously purchased the premium product, then your license details should say the duration is for a lifetime. However, Malwarebytes program allows the new legitimate key to working on premium for 12 months, and not life anymore.

## Malwarebytes Lifetime License

A **Lifetime License** does not have a renewal cost as it was configured to be a PC license with no expiration date. There is no renewal fee to maintain the license. If you purchased your **Subscription License** originally at the lower legacy pricing, then your renewal price will be a special privilege. You will see no increase in your annual subscription rate.

For example, for a subscription renewal, if you purchased in August of 2014, you have a yearly 3 PC license for $24.95 a year (plus local taxes). After the release of Malwarebytes 3 premium, you are eligible for a free upgrade to Malwarebytes 3 premium and your renewal will remain $24.95.

I have just got this on my phone but as yet I haven’t paid any more to have the premium. I don’t know much about what apps are going to be the best one to protect your bank details and basically everything on your phone. Please advise on this
