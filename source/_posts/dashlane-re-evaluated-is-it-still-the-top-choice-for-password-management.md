## Dashlane Re-Evaluated: Is It Still the Top Choice for Password Management?

Let’s kick things off by diving into Dashlane’s **unique selling proposition** – its patented security architecture. This includes a couple of standout features: zero-knowledge password sharing and dark web monitoring.  
  
Zero-knowledge password sharing means that even **Dashlane doesn’t know your passwords**. Your secrets are safe, folks! As for the dark web monitoring, it acts like your own personal cyber bodyguard, keeping watch for any sneaky cybercriminals trying to steal your data.  
  
**Dashlane is more than just a Password Manager**, it’s your all-in-one security concierge. Besides its password management capabilities, it offers an array of additional tools that work seamlessly. Some of its star features include:  
  
– **A VPN** that provides you with a private and secure browsing experience. It’s like your personal invisibility cloak in the digital world.  
– The **Password Health Checker**, your personal assistant for password strength. It gives you a [score on your password health](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/) and nudges you to take action on any weak, reused or compromised ones.  
– **Live Dark Web Monitoring**, your round-the-clock surveillance against cyber threats. If your data appears on the dark web, Dashlane will alert you immediately.  
  
Now, let’s talk about the elephant in the room – the cost. Dashlane’s Premium plan is undoubtedly secure, feature-rich, and easy to use. But, it’s also a bit pricier than some top competitors like 1Password and RoboForm. However, remember that with great power (features) comes great responsibility (cost).  
  
If you’re on a budget, **Dashlane Free is an excellent start**. It allows unlimited password storage on a single device and provides auto-save and auto-fill, password sharing, password auditing, and 1 GB of file storage. Not too shabby for a free version, right?  
  
If you’re looking to secure all members in the house, Dashlane’s Friends & Family plan is your go-to. It allows up to 10 users and includes a family management dashboard.  
  
Let’s wrap this up with an impressive stat – **Dashlane has never had a security breach**. That’s right, NEVER. In a world where data breaches are as common as cat videos on the internet, this is a noteworthy accomplishment.

## Dashlane Review in Brief

Dashlane is like the superhero of password managers, packing more power in its punch with a range of features that go beyond the basic password management functions. 

It simplifies your life with seamless auto-saving and auto-filling. What sets Dashlane apart are its impressive extras. How impressive, you ask? We’re talking about a high-quality VPN and live dark web monitoring.

But, what makes Dashlane the Superman of password managers? Let’s break it down.

![](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Dashlane-App.webp "Dashlane-App")

## Dashlane Features

### The Magic of Passkeys

Ever heard of passkey technology? Let me simplify it for you. When you register on a website compatible with passkey technology, you only need to enter your username or email as you normally would. The real magic happens in the background, where Dashlane generates two keys – a private key and a public key.  
  
Now, the public key goes straight to the website’s server you’re registering on. But here’s the catch – it’s pretty much useless without the private key. This private key stays locked away safely within your Dashlane app, springing into action only when you log into the website. The beauty of this system is that the two keys are mathematically related, and Dashlane uses both of them for authentication.  
  
And guess what? Dashlane has extended this support to its Android app. But before you get too excited, remember that it only works on Android 14\. If you’re still on Android 9 to 13, you can manage your passkeys in the app, but creating or using them is a no-go.

### Double Down on Security with Two Factor Authentication (2FA)

If you’re all about that extra layer of security (and who isn’t, right?), you’ll love Dashlane’s 2FA. Once you’ve got 2FA enabled, you’ll need a second form of authentication to log into your account. That could be for every login or just when you’re logging in from a new device. However, if you opt for 2FA every time, remember that you won’t be able to access your vault when offline.  
  
Now, Dashlane’s 2FA isn’t your average run-of-the-mill system. It requires you to use a TOTP-based authenticator app, like Google Authenticator, Duo Mobile, Authy, and so on. As a bonus, Dashlane provides you with backup codes as soon as you set up 2FA. These codes are your lifeline to access your password vault if your device with the 2FA authenticator app goes missing.  
  
What’s more, Dashlane even supports biometric logins. Yes, that’s right! This option is available on Android, iOS (including Touch ID and Face ID on supporting devices), Windows (using fingerprint authentication via Windows Hello), and Mac (with Touch ID on devices featuring the Touch Bar).

### Dashlane’s Password Generator: Simplicity at Its Best

Dashlane takes password creation to a new level with its password generator. It effortlessly generates 12-character passwords using all character sets, including numbers and symbols. The process is as straightforward as it gets, much like other providers. However, it does have a slight drawback – it lacks the ability to generate pronounceable word-based passwords for easier remembering, a feature that NordPass offers.

### Password Sharing

Sharing is, Surprisingly, Caring with Dashlane. You know that moment when you’re trying to share your Netflix account with your friend, but you don’t want to give away your password? Dashlane has got you covered. With its “Share Item” feature, you can give someone access to your account without them ever seeing your password. You just need to enter their email address, and voila, they’ll receive an email and a notification on Dashlane’s Sharing Centre. It’s as easy as pie, and infinitely more secure.

### A Health Check For Your Passwords

Ever wondered how strong your passwords really are? Or if you’ve reused a password one too many times? Dashlane’s password health score has got your back. **This little genie calculates how many compromised, reused, or weak passwords you have**. It’s like a health check-up, but for your passwords. The better your score, the safer your accounts. And if your password health isn’t looking too good, don’t worry. Dashlane will give you some handy tips to boost it back up.

### Virtual Private Network

**Believe it or not, Dashlane also has a built-in Virtual Private Network (VPN)**. Based on the reliable Hotspot Shield, Dashlane’s VPN promises unlimited bandwidth and servers in over 20 countries. But, let’s be clear: while this feature is a nice add-on, it might not be your best bet if you’re seeking a top-of-the-line VPN. Dashlane’s VPN does a decent job for casual encryption, but for more serious VPN needs, you might want to consider a dedicated service.

## Dashlane Cost : The Price You Pay

### Dashlane Free: A Good Start, But With Limits

The free version of Dashlane is like a coffee sample at your favorite café. It’s great for a sip, but it won’t get you through the day. **With Dashlane Free, you get a taste of the app’s features, but it’s limited to a single device.** Want a password manager that syncs across all your gadgets? You might be better off checking out Bitwarden or Avira Password Manager.

Here are the Features offered in Free version:

* Unlimited password storage.
* Password generator.
* Form and payment auto-fill.
* Secure notes.
* Password Health.
* 2FA with authenticator apps.
* Unlimited password sharing.
* Security alerts.
* Emergency contact access.
* 1 GB secure encrypted file storage.

### Dashlane Premium: The Real Deal

Enter Dashlane Premium, the full-bodied brew to Dashlane Free’s sample size cup. This plan offers all the features of the Free plan, and then some. Think of it like your digital security guard on steroids. You get:

* Sync across unlimited devices (because why should your phone have all the fun?)
* Dark web monitoring alerts (they’re like your mom, but for the internet)
* VPN with unlimited bandwidth (surf the net like nobody’s business)

### Dashlane Friends & Family: Share the Love

The Dashlane Friends & Family plan is like getting a pizza with unlimited toppings, where each topping is a user. It’s built for a default of five users, but you can add as many as you wish for a small fee. The big selling point here? Shared vaults for easy password sharing among family members. Think of it as a digital safety deposit box—only everyone has a key.

### Dashlane Starter: For Small Businesses with Big Security Needs

Next up, we have Dashlane Starter. It’s the cheapest business plan Dashlane offers, costing a flat rate for 10 seats (that’s techie talk for users). Here’s what each user gets:

* Unlimited passwords (because who can remember them all?)
* Secure sharing (because sharing is caring, but security is paramount)
* Business and personal password vaults (for when you’re on the clock and off it)
* Audit logs (to keep track of who’s doing what)
* Dark web monitoring (again, it’s like your mom, but for the web)

### Dashlane Business: The Powerhouse Solution

Finally, we come to Dashlane Business. This plan is a complete enterprise password management solution, with a few extra cherries on top. It includes everything in the Starter plan, plus:

* Single sign-on (SSO) integration (because remembering one password is easier than remembering many)
* SCIM provisioning (for a smoother onboarding experience)
* A free Friends & Family plan for all Business users
* Phone support (because sometimes, you just need to talk to a human)

For large companies, features like SSO integration, SCIM provisioning, and phone support can be game-changers. These tools let you easily manage hundreds or even thousands of employees’ passwords, admin tasks, onboarding, and much more.

## Ease of Use

Let’s dive into the Dashlane experience, shall we? Right off the bat**, Dashlane treats you to a unified experience — be it on a mobile app or a browser extension.** Just create an account (or log in if you’re already a member of the Dashlane club), and voilà, you’re all set! The best part? Adding or importing passwords is as simple as pie, and Dashlane proved to be an ace at detecting new logins at every site we tested. 

Feeling the need to generate a new password? No sweat! With a single click on Dashlane’s icon, the password generator pops up, even offering to save the new username and password in the app for you. Terrific, isn’t it? And let me tell you, the responsiveness of Dashlane’s web and mobile apps was top-notch during my testing.

### The Dashlane Mobile App: Your Pocket-Sized Security Guard

Let’s turn our attention to the Dashlane mobile password manager, shall we? If your device boasts facial recognition or a fingerprint reader, Dashlane gives you the option of enabling biometric security — a superb feature for master password recovery. But that’s not all! 

**Dashlane’s mobile app doubles as an authenticator**, so you can use it to access websites that use two-factor authentication. No need for an extra third-party app, like Google Authenticator. How’s that for convenience? 

**During my tests on my Samsung Galaxy S23 and iPhone 14**, I found Dashlane’s mobile app to be a breeze, mirroring the ease of use of its web counterpart. The auto-fill function performed flawlessly every time, making it hard to find any fault with Dashlane’s mobile app. The only hiccup? You can’t import passwords on the iOS version, but trust me, that’s a minor issue.

### Dashlane Web App: Your Browser’s Best Friend

Now onto Dashlane’s web app. What’s great about it is the standalone mode of the Dashlane browser extension. This makes the service easily accessible on platforms like Chromebook and Linux, which don’t have dedicated apps. 

Worried about the features? Don’t be! The web app version delivers the full feature experience. Storing, organizing, and securing passwords was a cakewalk under the dedicated Password section. So, if you’re a beginner taking your first steps in the password manager world, Dashlane will hold your hand and guide you through.

The flip side? If you’re off the grid, Dashlane’s web-only password manager won’t be accessible. That could be a potential drawback for some users, but for most, Dashlane’s pros far outweigh this minor con.

## Dashlane Customer Support

Let’s talk about the unsung hero of any software product – customer support. Dashlane has got a comprehensive help center, a smooth system for submitting trouble tickets, and a live chat feature that’s always ready to help you out.

And if that doesn’t solve your issues, Dashlane extends its support even outside of its official channels. You can find Dashlane’s dedicated staff on reddit, engaging with users and troubleshooting issues.

### Self-help Resources

For those who like to dig into the issue themselves before reaching out, Dashlane offers an extensive knowledge base and FAQs page. Want to know how to install the app or add extensions? They’ve got you covered with detailed step-by-step instructions.

I found these resources incredibly helpful when I had a few questions about app installation. I could get the answers I needed without having to wait for a response from a support agent.

### Live Chat Experience

Speaking of support agents, let me share my experience with Dashlane’s live chat. I wanted to test the responsiveness of their team, so I contacted them with a few queries.

Guess what? It took only 5 to 10 minutes to get in touch with an agent, and they provided swift and efficient solutions.

## The Final Verdict: Is Dashlane the Best Password Manager?

As a longtime user and reviewer of password managers, I can say Dashlane is a strong contender.

It offers more features than most competitors, and even provides a VPN – a feature you wouldn’t typically expect in a password manager. The password changer is an incredible time-saver, and I can’t stress enough how convenient this feature is.

However, I won’t shy away from pointing out a couple of areas where Dashlane can improve. For instance, it would be great if they allowed password sharing with non-Dashlane users. And I was disappointed to find out they discontinued U2F security keys as a second form of 2FA.

That said, Dashlane’s premium plan might seem slightly pricier than its competitors, but the cost is justified by the plethora of features you get.
