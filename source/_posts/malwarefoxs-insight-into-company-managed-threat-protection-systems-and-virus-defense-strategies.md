While there are [many options available to choose an antimalware](https://www.viruspup.com/software/best-antimalware.html) that suits your system’s compatibility and your budget, for Windows 10 users, Windows Defender does an excellent job.

Windows Defender is the inbuilt security solution of Windows. Though previously, it used to be heavily criticized because of its low effectiveness, from the past few years, Microsoft has improved a lot in it, and today it is one of the top security programs available.

Though, it is not free from bugs, and a lot of users frequently complaints about errors in it. One such error is this message:

> “Your Virus and Threat Protection Is Managed by Your Organization”

Some users reported that they are receiving this error message while they try to open or start scanning in the Windows Defender.

In this guide, we would discuss what the possible causes of this error are and some solutions to fix it.

Other than that, it could also occur when a malicious program alters the settings of Windows Defender.

In the following section, we would discuss some solutions to fix it.

## How to Fix “Your Virus and Threat Protection Is Managed by Your Organization”?

### **Remove DisableAntiSpyware using Command Prompt**

In the recent update, Microsoft has strangely disabled the anti-spyware capability of the Windows Defender. So to solve this, you have to remove the registry, which is stopping Windows Defender from acting against the Spyware.

1. **Open Command Prompt**
