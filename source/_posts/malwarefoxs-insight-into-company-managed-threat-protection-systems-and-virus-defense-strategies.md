While there are [many options available to choose an antimalware](https://www.viruspup.com/software/best-antimalware.html) that suits your system’s compatibility and your budget, for Windows 10 users, Windows Defender does an excellent job.

Windows Defender is the inbuilt security solution of Windows. Though previously, it used to be heavily criticized because of its low effectiveness, from the past few years, Microsoft has improved a lot in it, and today it is one of the top security programs available.

Though, it is not free from bugs, and a lot of users frequently complaints about errors in it. One such error is this message:

> “Your Virus and Threat Protection Is Managed by Your Organization”

Some users reported that they are receiving this error message while they try to open or start scanning in the Windows Defender.

### **Check for the Malware**

As we have discussed, there might be a malware that may have changed the settings of the Windows Defender and hence causing this trouble. So it is essential to catch and remove that malware to resolve the problem. You must use a proper antimalware for removing that. Here MalwareFox is used for the purpose.

Perform the full system scan, and after the process is complete, restart the computer. Now check if Windows Defender is running correctly or not. If not, then you should disable the other antimalware program and keep only Windows Defender active.

## Bottom Line

To summarize, in this guide, we have discussed what the possible causes and solutions for the error message “Your Virus and Threat Protection Is Managed by Your Organization” are. Although if you are still facing the problem, you can try any other antimalware and disable the Windows Defender.
